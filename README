Description of the program.
Author: Dmytro Dychenko.

The basis of the program is two sorted lists: orders, pickers. And the `Day Timer` with which we `live' the day.

Orders - contains information about orders. Sorted twice:
    First - by profitability (from expensive to cheap).
    Then - according to the urgency of the order. (The first one is the one that needs to be given
    before the others minus the lead time)

Pickers - contains information about pickers. There is only one sorting,
but it is sorted every time after receiving the work by picker.
Pickers are sorted according to the principle:
    Whoever runs out of an order earlier is higher.

At every minute of the working day, we check whether there are available deliverers.
If there are any, we go through the sorted list of orders until we find one that can be executed.
Unsuitable orders are deleted. A suitable order is deleted after reading the information.
If there are no more orders, the program terminates.
Picker changes the information about the end time of the order.
There is a new sorting of the list.
The Picker who is released before everyone else is in the first place.

This happens until the free pickers run out.
Then comes the next minute of time, where everything starts all over again.
